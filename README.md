# PCA-on-Financial-Market-in-2020

* It is a project that I have done for 'Data Science for Health' at NYU.
* Entirely done in Jupyter IDE, and detailed explanations are in the notebook as Markdown.
* For your convenience, I provide a latex file (https://github.com/jacob771/PCA-on-Financial-Market-in-2020/blob/main/PCA-on-Financial-Market-in-2020.pdf) as part of this project. You can see every work of mine very easily through this file.
* The conclusion is that even COVID-19, such an extremely dominating variable, could not provide a source to build linear model that predicts financial fluctuation accurately.
